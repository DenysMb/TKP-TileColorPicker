# TKP - Tile Color Picker
With this script you can set the header/tile color of a window to match with their main window color.

## How to use
- First we need to make the script executable. We can do it with `chmod +x tkp`
- Then, we can just execute it with `./tkp` and follow the steps from terminal

## Check too
You can check too my others two scripts:
- [WCG - Wallpaper Color Scheme Generator](https://github.com/DenysMb/WCG-WallpaperColorSchemeGenerator): With this script you can automatically generate a color-scheme based on your wallpaper.
- [CSG - Color Scheme Generator](https://github.com/DenysMb/CSG-ColorSchemeGenerator): With this script you can easily generate any color-scheme by using a color picker.
